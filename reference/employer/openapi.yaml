    The Finch HRIS API provides a unified way to connect to a multitide of HRIS systems. The API requires an access token issued by Finch.

    By default, Organization, Census, and Payroll requests use Finch's [Data Syncs](docs/Development-Guides/Data-Syncs.md). If a request is made before the initial sync has completed, Finch will request data live from the provider. The latency on live requests may range from seconds to minutes depending on the provider and batch size.
    Benefits requests (both read and write) are always made live to the provider. Latencies may range from seconds to minutes depending on the provider and batch size.


    Employer products are specified by the product parameter, a space-separated list of products that your application requests from an employer authenticating through Finch Connect. Valid product names are—
    - `company`: Read basic company data

    - `directory`: Read company directory and organization structure

    - `individual`: Read individual data, excluding income and employment data

    - `employment`: Read individual employment and income data

    - `payment`: Read payroll and contractor related payments by the company

    - `pay_statement`: Read detailed pay statements for each individual

    - `benefits`: Create and manage benefits and benefit enrollment within a company

    - `deduction` (deprecated): Previously used to manage deductions within a company. Please use `benefits`.

        Disconnect one or more `access_token`s from your application. Deletion is based on both the employer and provider of the `access_token` used to call this endpoint, and will also delete all tokens with the same employer/provider pair. Other tokens for the same employer, but connected to a different provider, require a separate call.
        <br /><br />We require applications to implement the Disconnect endpoint for billing and security purposes.

        If the same request is made more than once with the same `benefit_type` and `description`, a new benefit will not be created. Finch will instead return the benefit id of the existing benefit.

        Enqueue an automated job. Currently, only the `data-sync-all` job type is supported, which will enqueue a job to re-sync all data for a connection. `data-sync-all` has a concurrency limit of 1 job at a time per connection. This means that if this endpoint is called while a job is already in progress for this connection, Finch will return the `job_id` of the job that is currently in progress. Finch allows a fixed window rate limit of 1 forced refresh per hour.

        This endpoint is available for *Scale* tier customers as an add-on. To request access to this endpoint, please contact your Finch account manager.
