# Registration

To get started, sign up for a free account at [https://dashboard.tryfinch.com/signup](https://dashboard.tryfinch.com/signup). After registration, you will be given a `client_id` and `client_secret` to build and test how Finch works using our sandbox environment â€” a test environment with life-like data. Continue to our [quickstart](./3-Quickstart.md) to send your first request to Finch's API.

<!-- theme: info -->
> This `client_id` and `client_secret` will only work for the sandbox provider. If you would like to test real providers with live data, you must request developer keys from [developers@tryfinch.com](mailto:developers@tryfinch.com).

If you need any help anytime during the registration or testing process, please email us at [developers@tryfinch.com](mailto:developers@tryfinch.com).
