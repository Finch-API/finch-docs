# Handling API Responses

## Finch IDs

All IDs (UUIDs) returned by Finch endpoints are fixed for the same underlying employment system account. They will not change even if you have multiple `access_token`s for the company, a different payroll admin from a company logs in, etc.

## Null Values

API responses can return `null` values for some fields. This can happen for a few different reasonsâ€”

1. The employment system does not support the field.
2. The field is supported by the employment system but the data has not been filled in by the payroll administrator of a company.
3. Finch was not able to infer a reasonable value (for example, the categorization of a tax).

> Ensure your Finch integration is resilient to `null` values.

## 202 Response Codes

In some cases, requests to the Finch API may return a [`202 accepted`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/202) status code. This is often the case for async operations, such as:
* Requests for connections using [Assisted Connect](docs/Product-Guides/Assisted-Connect-Flow.md), including [Assisted Benefits](../Product-Guides/Benefits-API.md#handling-assisted-benefits-api-responses)
* Requests for [pay statements](docs/Development-Guides/Data-Syncs.md#pay-statements) which exist but have not yet been fetched
* Requests for connections utilizing [authentication fallback](docs/Product-Guides/Automated-Connect-Flow.md#authentication-fallback)

Your implementation should be built to account for these 202 responses.
