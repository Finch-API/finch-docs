# Handling API Responses

## Finch IDs

All IDs (UUIDs) returned by Finch endpoints are fixed for the same underlying employment system account. They will not change even if you have multiple `access_token`s for the company, a different payroll admin from a company logs in, etc.

## Null Values

API responses can return `null` values for some fields. This can happen for a few different reasonsâ€”

1. The employment system does not support the field.
2. The field is supported by the employment system but the data has not been filled in by the payroll administrator of a company.
3. Finch was not able to infer a reasonable value (for example, the categorization of a tax).
