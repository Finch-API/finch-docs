# SDKs

### Backend SDKs
Finch maintains SDKs in several popular languages to make it easy to integrate with Finch APIs. These SDKs are regularly updated for breaking and non-breaking API changes, and are generated from our [OpenAPI](https://github.com/Finch-API/finch-openapi) schema. In addition to the installation and quickstart information, each repository contains an `api.md` which documents available methods and data models.

* [Node](https://github.com/Finch-API/finch-api-node)
* [Python](https://github.com/Finch-API/finch-api-python)
* [Java](https://github.com/Finch-API/finch-api-java)

If you do not see your language here, reach out to us!

### Frontend SDKs

Finch's frontend SDKs allow you to [embed Finch Connect](Embed-Connect.md) into your application, enabling you to provide a seamless integration experience for your users. Take a look at our repositories below:
* [Javascript](https://github.com/Finch-API/finch-connect-js)
