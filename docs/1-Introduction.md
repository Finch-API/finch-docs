# What is Finch?

People are the most important component of an organization, yet the data required to understand a companyâ€™s investment in its workforce is locked away across payroll, HR, and benefits systems. The employment data ecosystem is highly fragmented making it challenging to derive insights from disparate data sources and to act on those insights.

Finch makes it easy to read workforce data and push changes across providers (payroll, HRIS, time management, etc) using HTTP requests.
