# Registration

To get started, register your application with Finch by emailing [jeremy@tryfinch.com](mailto:jeremy@tryfinch.com).

After registration, your application will be assigned a client ID and a client secret. The client secret must be kept safe and used only in exchanges between your application's server and Finch's server (`https://api.tryfinch.com`).
